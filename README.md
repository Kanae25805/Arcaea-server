# Arcaea-server
A small local server for Arcaea

## Introduction
This is a small local Arcaea server based on Python and Flask, which can simulate the main functions of the game. I completed it on the spur of the moment in five days. This may be the first time I have written such a large program. Please understand if there is something wrong with it.
